# Optimization Code and Multiport Dataset for Handset Antenna System Design

## Overview
This repository provides MATLAB implementation of multi-objective optimization algorithms and a multiport dataset for **handset antenna system design**.  
The framework enables automated optimization and evaluation of antenna systems under realistic device constraints, supporting reproducibility and further research.

## Features
- Multi-objective optimization using NSGA-III and GA-based operators.  
- Support for multiport network evaluation with scattering matrix data.  
- Includes pre-computed datasets (`.mat` files) for quick testing and benchmarking.  
- Configurable number of ports and feeds for flexible handset antenna scenarios.  
- Example `main.m` script to reproduce optimization results.
